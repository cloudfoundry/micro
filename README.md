API
===

The Micro Cloud has a hypermedia/REST API. Starting at the root resource, each
resource is exposed via named links in the _links element. The links give the
client the expected HTTP method, URL and content type for each state.

Clients should start at the root and navigate through links for each request.
They should use the methods, URLs and content types that are returned and
not build any URLs themselves.

The API is browsable using a browser with a JSON formatting plugin like
JSONView installed.

API Architecture
================

Media Types
-----------

Each resource has a media type class that is a subclass of Engine::MediaType.
Subclasses define a MediaType class constant for their content type and a
set of links to other resources.

Links
-----

The format of the links in JSON is based on the link format of HAL with a few
additions: http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html

Serialization and Content Types
-------------------------------

The MediaTypeSerial Rack middleware automatically parses incoming JSON
into the correct MediaType subclass based on its content type. The
media type object is set as env['media_type_object'] in Rack environment.

This middleware also serializes MediaType subclasses to JSON based on their
instance variables and sets the correct content type on responses.

Routes
------

Classes in the Routes module are automatically registered in the Sinatra
app.

Code Organization
-----------------

The Engine module is intended for generic hypermedia API code that might
eventually be moved to a separate project.
